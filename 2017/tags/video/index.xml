&lt;h1 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite our hand in their design, and hence their seemingly deterministic
operation, electronic systems grow ever more complex and are often most simply
characterized through measurement-driven modeling. This workshop presents
measurements of the rate at which bits are produced as output of a compression
algorithm for a digital video camera. The data are produced by presenting the
camera with a variety of test scenes, and operating it over a variety of
settings. The data presented here can both simulate the camera&amp;rsquo;s bit rate as a
function of operating conditions for design purposes, as well as provide some
insight into how the camera&amp;rsquo;s compression algorithm operates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several other goals will be presented, and participants will be free to
investigate a variety of possible directions with the data.  Perhaps most
importantly, complete details of how the data are generated &amp;mdash; namely the
internal workings of the camera&amp;rsquo;s algorithm &amp;mdash; are not available.  Despite this
fact, we believe that systems as elaborate as those that can control the
camera&amp;rsquo;s bit rate under changing conditions can be achieved with good modeling
practice on these available data.&lt;/p&gt;
