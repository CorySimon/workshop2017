&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different cell types in humans possess approximately the same genome despite
having dramatically different functions. Gene regulation is the complex process
by which cells selectively synthesize different proteins encoded in their
genome. [1] A fundamental understanding of how genes are regulated can lead
towards effective treatments for cancers and developmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enhancers are distal regulatory elements that, in conjunction with a promoter,
recruit the proteins required to drive transcription of a gene. While the
~20,000 genes in the human genome are known, we have not identified all of the
enhancers linked to each gene. The goal of this project is to leverage Altius’s
data on the genome-wide regulatory landscape [2] to match candidate enhancers
with promoters (and, thus, genes) and identify synergistic protein binding
motifs that can reveal key players in enhancer-promoter gene
expression. Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) [3] are a natural machine
learning algorithm to approach such questions, as they automatically discover
relevant protein binding motifs in DNA sequences from training data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenges include building an interpretable and explainable ConvNet to extract biological insights from our genome-wide regulatory landscape data sets;
and mapping DNA sequences to a vector space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.altius.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Altius Institute for Biomedical Sciences&lt;/a&gt; is an
independent, not-for-profit research institute based in Seattle,
Washington. Altius aims to unlock the potential of the living genome to open
new frontiers for basic science, technology development, and translational
medicine. Altius is developing transformative technologies to understand how a
cell’s genome controls its function in health and disease, and to translate
this understanding effectively into clinical settings in the discovery of new
medicines.&lt;/p&gt;
