The 2017 Workshop in Data Science is aimed at graduate students in the Institute of Applied Mathematics at UBC, and students at SFU with similar interests, who have strong mathematical skills but little or no experience with "data science". The workshop is designed to give this type of student some experience that will be helpful in their research (if it involves large data sets) and in their career options after graduation. 

The workshop will include lectures on the theory of algorithms used in data science, and the use of freeware implementations of the methods. Data sets from industry and government will be introduced by guest speakers and used as examples. Each data set will lead to a capstone project. Computational work will be done with Jupyter notebooks. Participants will learn common data structures and how to reorganize and “clean” data; and subsequent analysis using machine learning, data clustering, parameter fitting, and other techniques. 

There will be several data sets used in the workshop. We will add in the
details as they become finalized:

* Data-driven modeling of video compression  
  Roger Donaldson, Ph.D. (Midvale Applied Mathematics)
* Inferring risk evaluation from incident and permitting data  
  Soyean Kim, P.Stat. ([BC Safety Authority](https://www.safetyauthority.ca/))
