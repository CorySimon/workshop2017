# About

Targeted at graduate students in the
Institute of Applied Mathematics at UBC and students at SFU with similar
interests, the 2017 IAM Workshop in Data Science will develop data science
competency in students with strong mathematical skills who may have little or no
previous experience in the world of "data science".

This workshop will give students experience with data science tools &mdash;
such as working with large data sets, statistical inference, and machine
learning &mdash; that will be helpful in their research, as well as in their
career options after graduation. See below for
[additional information](#info).
