<!-- The 2017 Workshop in Data Science is aimed at graduate students in the Institute of Applied Mathematics at UBC, and students at SFU with similar interests, who have strong mathematical skills but little or no experience with "data science". The workshop is designed to give this type of student some experience that will be helpful in their research (if it involves large data sets) and in their career options after graduation.  -->

# Summary

The two-week workshop will include both theoretical and practical
components, featuring lectures on the theory of algorithms used in data science
and the freeware implementation of these methods. In the first week, data sets
from industry and government will be introduced by guest speakers and used as
examples data sets for mini-projects. Each data set will lead to a capstone
project in the second week.

Computational work will be done with Jupyter notebooks using
[syzygy.ca](https://ubc.syzygy.ca). Participants will have the opportunity to
work with big data, and learn subsequent analysis motifs using machine learning, data clustering, parameter fitting, and other techniques. 

There will be a short course in linear algebra and software tools prior to the
workshop to cover background material in scientific computing, linear algebra,
statistical methods and optimization. For more information, see the
[pre-workshop description](./post/prequel-description).

# Projects Overview

There will be several data sets used in the workshop. We will add in the
details as they become finalized. For full project/data details, visit the
